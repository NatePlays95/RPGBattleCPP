# second version!

added new D&D-like dice rolls and character stats (refered as params)

externalized classes to a new file, and battle manager now uses pointers




# compiling instructions (Windows Only):

Compile the three source files in one command, like gcc main.cpp managers.cpp classes.cpp

That should give you .o or .obj files.

With gcc you can build the three at once with gcc main.o managers.o classes.o

which will make an .exe file.


# TO DO:

deploy for end users
